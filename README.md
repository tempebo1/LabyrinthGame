# LabyrinthGame

The Labyrinth game is a game where the players rearrange the maze to
their advantage by moving a row of pieces in turn. Each
player has one token, which they move in the maze. The
player's goal is to collect treasures in the labyrinth and then
return to their own starting position.
The game is a virtual version of the original board labyrinth game, <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_(board_game>).
